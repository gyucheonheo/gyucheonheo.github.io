My name is Gyucheon Heo. I go by **Jake**. I see myself as an inspiring Software Engineer and Developer.
My research and interesting lie at the software stacks of Web Service, however all applications, to ensure high availability and fault-tolerance. More specifically, the main question around my life is "Are current software stacks enough to handle later greater/larger dataset being requested and being responsed?". On top of that, I am also interested in Test-Driven Development, the methodologies of software tests. In general, I have affinity toward everything curious.
